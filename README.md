# Sliced-Wasserstein-Flows
Research Project for the Computational Optimal Transport (MVA) of Prof. Gabriel Peyré on the paper from Antoine Liutkus, Umut Şimşekli, Szymon Majewski, Alain Durmus, and Fabian-Robert Stöter: "Sliced-wasserstein flows: Nonparametric generative modeling via optimal transport and diffusions." 

Work done :

1. Summarizing the method and the related background
2. Analysis of the impact of the number of random directions on the unit sphere to simulate the gradient flow
3. Testing on various distributions
